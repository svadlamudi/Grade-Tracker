# Grade Tracker
An iOS app which helps maintain course grades for terms, semesters and years. It works both with a point and percentage system. It lists the averages for both groups of grades as well as the overall average, allowing one to see where improvement is needed. It is also easy to add dummy assignments to see what grades are needed to get averages to desired point.
